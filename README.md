## Installation

```python
pip install warrant-python
```

## Usage

```python
import warrant

warrant.api_key = "api_test_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E="

warrant.User.create()
warrant.Tenant.create(id="dunder_mifflin")
```

## Configuring the API Endpoint
---
The API endpoint the SDK makes requests to is configurable via the `warrant.api_endpoint` attribute:

```python
import warrant

# Set api endpoint to http://localhost:8000
warrant.api_endpoint = 'http://localhost:8000'
```

Weâ€™ve used a random API key in these code examples. Replace it with your
[actual publishable API keys](https://app.warrant.dev) to
test this code through your own Warrant account.

For more information on how to use the Warrant API, please refer to the
[Warrant API reference](https://docs.warrant.dev).

Note that we may release new [minor and patch](https://semver.org/) versions of this library with small but backwards-incompatible fixes to the type declarations. These changes will not affect Warrant itself.
